Hi, here is Zheyuan! 

I'm a computer science bachlor student at [Saarland University], and I'm on a journey to discover my research passions. Here are the areas I'm currently intrigued by: 
Type system, 
Program analysis and Automated debugging, 
Security testing and Verification

<!-- I enjoy learning new abstract theories at university and would like to find more motivation through practice. So I am currently looking for a student job in coding, for any ideas or information please feel free to [email me] :D -->

I'm on the lookout for any opportunities to do some research - internships, research assistant, or anything else. Just drop me an email if there's a possibility :D
